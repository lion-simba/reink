## How to get my printer supported?
See [here](http://lion-simba.github.io/reink/report.html).

## Usage
Compile (`make`) and run (`./reink`) the program without arguments. :)
In most cases you would need to power-off and then power-on your printer after reseting ink level. This will allow printer
to save new data in the cartridges.
